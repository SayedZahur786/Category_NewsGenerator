## 🛠️🔧 How It Was Built

This project was built using the following technologies and tools:

- **Frontend** 🖥️: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **API** 🌐: [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) for fetching real-time news articles.
- **CORS Proxy** 🔄: [api.allorigins.win](https://api.allorigins.win/) to bypass CORS restrictions.
- **Hosting** 🚀: Deployed on **GitHub Pages** for easy access.

The app dynamically fetches news articles based on the selected category or search query. The UI is designed to be clean and user-friendly, with a focus on readability and responsiveness. 🎨✨

## ❓🤔 Common Questions

### Q: Why am I seeing "No articles found"? 🤷‍♂️
A: This could happen if:
   - The selected category has no articles available.
   - The search query doesn’t match any articles.
   - There’s an issue with the API key. Make sure your API key is valid and correctly added to the `script.js` file.

### Q: How do I fix CORS issues? 🛠️
A: The app uses **api.allorigins.win** as a proxy to bypass CORS restrictions. If the proxy is down, you can replace it with an alternative proxy like [thingproxy.freeboard.io](https://thingproxy.freeboard.io/fetch/).

### Q: Can I customize the UI? 🎨
A: Absolutely! You can modify the `styles.css` file to change colors, fonts, layouts, or animations to suit your preferences.

### Q: Why is JavaScript shown as the main language in the repository? 🤔
A: The `.gitattributes` file is used to prioritize JavaScript in GitHub’s language detection. This doesn’t remove HTML or CSS but ensures JavaScript is highlighted as the primary language.
